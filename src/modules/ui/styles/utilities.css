/* Reserved for edge-case utility classes per FR-017 */

/*
 * This file serves as an escape hatch for one-off styles that don't fit
 * the component-scoped CSS Modules pattern.
 *
 * Usage: Add minimal global utility classes here ONLY when:
 * 1. The style cannot be reasonably added to a component CSS Module
 * 2. The rationale is documented in a comment above the utility class
 * 3. Approved in code review
 *
 * Example:
 * .sr-only {
 *   position: absolute;
 *   width: 1px;
 *   height: 1px;
 *   overflow: hidden;
 *   clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
 * }
