Prioritize backlog:
1) Fetch or receive open issues; classify (bug/feature/docs/etc.).
2) Score on impact, urgency, risk, effort; note dependencies/blockers.
3) Recommend next issues to tackle; suggest labels.
4) Output concise priority list and rationale; propose next steps (plan/implement/test/review/deploy).
Reference `.claude/AGENTS.md`, `.claude/COMMANDS.md`, and repo AGENTS/instructions.
