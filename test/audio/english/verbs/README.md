## How to Generate Audio Files

### Option 1: Using the Python Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Install gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
pip install gtts

# Run the generation script
python3 generate-audio.py
```

The script will automatically:
- Generate all 90 MP3 files
- Save them to this directory
- Skip files that already exist

### Option 2: Using Online TTS Services

Visit services like:
- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech**: https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech
- **Amazon Polly**: https://aws.amazon.com/polly/
- **Microsoft Azure Speech**: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/

Generate British or American English pronunciations for each verb form.

### Option 3: Record Your Own

Record yourself or a native speaker pronouncing each word clearly, then save as MP3 files with the correct filenames.

## Audio Format Requirements

- **Format**: MP3
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz (CD quality) or 22.05 kHz
- **Bit Rate**: 128 kbps or higher
- **Duration**: 0.5-1.5 seconds per word
- **Volume**: Normalized to -3dB peak

## Testing Audio

After generating the files, test them in the learning platform:
1. Start the learning path: "UnregelmÃ¤ÃŸige Verben - Englisch"
2. Click the audio button (ðŸ”Š) next to each answer
3. Verify pronunciation is clear and correct

## Notes

- Audio is marked with `hasAudio: true` and `audioUrl` in the JSON
- Files are loaded from `/audio/english/verbs/` (relative to public dir)
- The platform's AudioButton component handles playback
- Audio buttons will show as disabled (ðŸ”‡) until files are present
