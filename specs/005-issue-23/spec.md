## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: What should be the default auto-play delay when a new question appears? ‚Üí A: Short delay (500ms) for non-German content only. Audio plays for foreign language questions and answers after 500ms delay. Audio button remains for manual replay.
- Q: How many times should audio automatically repeat for beginner vs advanced learners? ‚Üí A: Always play once for all difficulty levels, user manually replays if needed.
- Q: What playback speed increments should be available for audio control? ‚Üí A: No speed control - Fixed 1x playback only.
- Q: How should the system preload audio files to optimize performance? ‚Üí A: Next question only - Preload just the next question's audio.
- Q: How should audio behave when the browser tab loses/gains focus? ‚Üí A: Keep playing - Continue playing audio even when tab is not focused.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a language learner**, I want audio to play automatically when non-German content (questions or answers) appears, so that I can focus on listening and learning pronunciation without manually clicking the play button, creating a more immersive learning experience.

### Current Pain Points
- Students must manually click play button for every Spanish question
- Easy to forget to play audio, missing pronunciation practice
- Extra clicks disrupt learning flow and concentration
- Not ideal for listening comprehension exercises
- Mobile users find repeated button clicks cumbersome

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a student starts a Spanish vocabulary practice session, **When** the first question (in Spanish) appears with audio available, **Then** the audio plays automatically after 500ms delay and the student hears the Spanish pronunciation

1a. **Given** a German language question appears, **When** the question is displayed, **Then** NO audio plays automatically (audio only for non-German content)

1b. **Given** a Spanish answer is revealed, **When** the answer is displayed, **Then** the Spanish audio plays automatically after 500ms delay

2. **Given** audio is playing automatically, **When** the student wants to hear it again, **Then** they can replay the audio using a replay button or keyboard shortcut without waiting for it to finish

3. **Given** a student has disabled auto-play in settings, **When** a new question with audio appears, **Then** the audio does NOT play automatically and the play button is shown instead

4. **Given** the browser blocks auto-play due to policy restrictions, **When** the student first interacts with the page (any click), **Then** auto-play becomes enabled for subsequent questions and the student is notified

5. **Given** a student is on any Spanish lesson (beginner or advanced), **When** audio plays automatically, **Then** it plays once and the student can use the replay button for additional listening

6. **Given** a student is using keyboard navigation, **When** they press the replay shortcut key, **Then** the current question's audio plays from the beginning

7. **Given** audio is currently playing, **When** the student navigates to the next question, **Then** the current audio stops and the new question's audio begins playing

8. **Given** audio is playing in a browser tab, **When** the student switches to a different tab or app, **Then** the audio continues playing in the background without interruption

### Edge Cases
- What happens when browser blocks auto-play? ‚Üí System detects block, shows one-time notification explaining user interaction needed, enables auto-play after first click
- How does system handle missing audio files? ‚Üí Falls back to manual play button, logs missing audio for content team
- What happens when user switches between questions rapidly? ‚Üí Previous audio stops immediately, new audio queues and plays
- How does it work for deaf or hearing-impaired users? ‚Üí Auto-play can be permanently disabled in accessibility settings, Spanish text shown prominently with IPA pronunciation guide
- What happens on slow network when audio hasn't loaded? ‚Üí Shows loading indicator, plays when ready, or times out after 5 seconds and shows manual play button
- How does it handle simultaneous audio from multiple tabs? ‚Üí Audio continues playing even when tab loses focus (background playback enabled)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Core Auto-Play**
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically play audio pronunciation ONLY for non-German content (foreign language questions and answers) after a 500ms delay, if auto-play is enabled in user settings
- **FR-001a**: System MUST NOT auto-play audio for German language content (German questions or German answers)
- **FR-001b**: System MUST auto-play answer audio (if non-German) when the answer is revealed, after 500ms delay
- **FR-002**: System MUST stop any currently playing audio when a new question loads, before starting the new audio
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect browser auto-play policy restrictions and handle them gracefully by enabling auto-play after the first user interaction
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide visual feedback showing audio playback status (playing, paused, stopped) with appropriate icons or animations
- **FR-004a**: System MUST always show an audio replay button for manual playback, regardless of auto-play status

**User Controls**
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to replay the current audio at any time using a replay button or keyboard shortcut
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to enable or disable auto-play through settings, with preference persisted across sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST play audio at fixed 1x playback speed (no speed adjustment controls needed)
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to control audio using keyboard shortcuts (Space: pause/resume, R: replay, S: stop)

**Audio Settings**
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to configure auto-play behavior per learning path (Spanish: enabled by default, Math/Biology: disabled)
- **FR-010**: System MUST play audio exactly once during auto-play, with manual replay available via button or keyboard shortcut (no automatic repetition)
- **FR-011**: System MUST use a fixed 500ms delay before auto-play starts (user configurable delay removed - simplified UX)
- **FR-012**: System MUST remember audio settings per user and apply them across all sessions

**Performance & Loading**
- **FR-013**: System MUST preload ONLY the next question's audio file to minimize playback delay while conserving bandwidth
- **FR-013a**: System MUST NOT batch preload multiple questions to avoid unnecessary data usage
- **FR-014**: System MUST show loading indicator if audio is not ready within 1 second of question display
- **FR-015**: System MUST timeout audio loading after 5 seconds and fall back to manual play button

**Accessibility**
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide screen reader announcements for audio playback status changes
- **FR-017**: System MUST offer alternative learning mode for deaf/hearing-impaired users with visual pronunciation guides (IPA notation)
- **FR-018**: System MUST allow complete disabling of all audio features through accessibility settings
- **FR-019**: System MUST ensure keyboard shortcuts for audio control are documented and accessible

**Behavior Rules**
- **FR-020**: System MUST play audio once for all difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) with consistent behavior
- **FR-021**: System MUST continue playing audio even when browser tab loses focus (background playback enabled for uninterrupted learning)
- **FR-022**: System MUST clear audio queue when user exits practice session or closes the application
