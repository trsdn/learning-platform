## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific Tailwind utilities, CSS-in-JS libs)
- üë• Written for project maintainers and contributors

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the learning platform, I need a consistent styling approach across all components so that I can:
- Write styles in a predictable, uniform way
- Understand and modify existing component styles quickly
- Avoid confusion about which styling method to use
- Benefit from build optimizations (tree-shaking, purging unused styles)
- Maintain a cohesive visual design system

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer is creating a new UI component, **When** they reference the project guidelines, **Then** they should find clear documentation on the chosen styling approach with examples

2. **Given** a developer is modifying an existing component, **When** they open the component file, **Then** the styling should use the standardized approach (not mixed methods)

3. **Given** a developer runs the build process, **When** the build completes, **Then** unused styles should be automatically purged (if using utility-first CSS) or properly scoped (if using modules)

4. **Given** a developer is reviewing a pull request, **When** they check styling code, **Then** they should see consistent patterns matching the project standard

5. **Given** the codebase has been migrated, **When** a developer searches for styling patterns, **Then** they should find only one approach in use (no legacy inline styles)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a component needs dynamic styles based on props? [Standard should support this use case via CSS custom properties or conditional classes]
- How does the system handle third-party component libraries with their own styling? [Case-by-case evaluation documented in CLAUDE.md]
- What about one-off styles that don't fit the pattern? [Create minimal global utility class in utilities.css as escape hatch]
- How are animations and transitions standardized? [Should be part of the standard via design tokens]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Decision & Documentation
- **FR-001**: Project MUST have a single, documented styling approach chosen from: utility-first CSS (Tailwind), CSS Modules, or CSS-in-JS
- **FR-002**: Decision MUST be documented in CLAUDE.md with clear rationale
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST include examples of common patterns (buttons, cards, forms, layouts)
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST specify how to handle dynamic styles and theming
- **FR-016**: Third-party UI library styling approach MUST be evaluated case-by-case and documented in CLAUDE.md

#### Migration & Consistency
- **FR-005**: All components in `src/modules/ui/components/` MUST use the standardized approach
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT have mixed styling approaches (except during migration period)
- **FR-007**: Migration guide MUST be provided for converting existing components
- **FR-008**: Existing visual design MUST be preserved during migration (zero visual regression verified via automated Playwright screenshot comparison tests)
- **FR-015**: All ~15 components MUST be migrated in a single PR (big bang approach) for faster completion and immediate consistency
- **FR-018**: Migration issues MUST be fixed forward in follow-up commits (no rollback/revert allowed)

#### Build & Tooling
- **FR-009**: Build configuration MUST be optimized for the chosen approach (e.g., Tailwind purge config, CSS Module tree-shaking)
- **FR-010**: Development tools MUST support the chosen approach (editor autocomplete, linting)
- **FR-011**: Build output MUST NOT include unused styles

#### Code Quality
- **FR-012**: Linting rules MUST enforce the chosen styling approach
- **FR-013**: Pull request template or checklist MUST include styling consistency check
- **FR-014**: Component examples/templates MUST demonstrate the standard approach
- **FR-017**: Edge case styles that don't fit component-scoped CSS Modules MUST be added as minimal global utility classes in utilities.css with documented rationale

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: How should component migration be executed? ‚Üí A: Big bang - migrate all ~15 components in a single PR (higher risk, faster completion)
- Q: How should visual regression be verified during migration? ‚Üí A: Screenshot comparison - automated Playwright screenshot tests comparing pre/post migration states
- Q: How should third-party UI libraries (e.g., date pickers, modals) be handled? ‚Üí A: Case-by-case - evaluate each third-party library individually and document in CLAUDE.md
- Q: How should one-off styles (that don't fit CSS Modules pattern) be handled? ‚Üí A: Global utility escape hatch - create minimal global utility class for the specific edge case
- Q: What is the rollback strategy if migration causes critical issues? ‚Üí A: Fix forward - no rollback allowed, must fix issues in follow-up commits

### Current State Analysis
The codebase currently has:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Already configured, used in `audio-button.tsx`
- **Inline styles**: Used in dashboard, practice-session, session-results, and other components
- **No CSS Modules**: Not currently in use

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (specific Tailwind utilities, CSS-in-JS libraries)
- [x] Focused on developer experience and maintainability
- [x] Written for technical stakeholders (developers, architects)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (FR-015 clarified: big bang migration)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (zero visual regression, no mixed approaches)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (styling standardization only)
- [x] Dependencies identified (build tools, existing Tailwind config)

### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ 100% of components use the chosen styling approach
- ‚úÖ Zero visual regression in UI after migration
- ‚úÖ Build output contains no unused styles
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md contains comprehensive styling guidelines
- ‚úÖ All developers can find and follow the standard

## Recommendation from Issue

The original issue recommends **standardizing on Tailwind CSS** because:
1. Already configured in the project
2. Smaller bundle size (unused classes purged)
3. Better developer experience with autocomplete
4. Consistent with existing audio-button component

This recommendation should be validated during the planning phase.
