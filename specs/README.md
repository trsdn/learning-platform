# Feature Specifications

This directory contains feature specifications and implementation plans.

## Structure

- `active/` - Currently being implemented
- `completed/` - Archived completed specifications
- `template/` - Specification templates

## Workflow

1. Create new specs in `active/` using templates from `template/`
2. Move completed specs to `completed/` after implementation
3. Include spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md for each feature

## Specification Format

Each feature specification should include:
- `spec.md` - Feature requirements and design
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown
- `contracts/` - API contracts and interfaces (optional)
