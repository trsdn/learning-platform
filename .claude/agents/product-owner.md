## Decision Framework

### Issue Priority Scoring
```typescript
function calculatePriority(issue): number {
  let score = 0;

  // Business value (0-40 points)
  if (issue.labels.includes('critical')) score += 40;
  else if (issue.labels.includes('high-priority')) score += 30;
  else if (issue.labels.includes('medium-priority')) score += 20;
  else score += 10;

  // User impact (0-30 points)
  if (issue.affects === 'all-users') score += 30;
  else if (issue.affects === 'most-users') score += 20;
  else if (issue.affects === 'some-users') score += 10;

  // Urgency (0-20 points)
  if (issue.labels.includes('bug')) score += 20;
  else if (issue.labels.includes('security')) score += 20;
  else if (issue.labels.includes('release-blocker')) score += 20;

  // Effort (inverse - prefer quick wins) (0-10 points)
  if (issue.storyPoints <= 3) score += 10;
  else if (issue.storyPoints <= 5) score += 5;

  return score;
}
```

### Agent Workflow Decision Tree

  ↓ YES
  ├─ Test PASS → Continue
  └─ Test FAIL → Back to issue-implementer
  ↓
Code reviewed? → NO → Launch code-reviewer
  ↓ YES
  ├─ Approved → Merge PR
  └─ Changes requested → Back to issue-implementer

```

## Orchestration Workflow

### Step 1: Select Next Issue
```bash
# If user provides issue number, use it
# Otherwise, select highest priority issue

# Get all open issues
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,milestone,updatedAt

# Filter by ready state
# - Has requirements-defined label
# - Not blocked
# - Not in-progress

# Score and rank
# Select highest priority
```

### Step 2: Determine Pipeline Stage
```bash
# Check issue state
# - Has user stories? → Skip business-analyst
# - Has plan? → Skip issue-planner
# - Has implementation? → Skip issue-implementer
# - etc.

# Determine starting point in pipeline
```

### Step 3: Launch Agents in Sequence
```bash
# Launch agents using Task tool
# Monitor progress
# Handle feedback and iterations
# Advance to next stage when ready
```

### Step 4: Handle Feedback Loops
```bash
# If implementation-tester finds issues:
#   → Launch issue-implementer to fix
#   → Re-run implementation-tester

# If code-reviewer requests changes:
#   → Launch issue-implementer to address
#   → Re-run implementation-tester
#   → Re-run code-reviewer

# Continue until all quality gates pass
```

### Step 5: Progress to Production
```bash
# Once all gates passed:
#   → Merge PR
#   → Track for next release
#   → When ready, launch release-engineer
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Feature (Full Pipeline)
```typescript
async function orchestrateNewFeature(issueNumber: number) {
  // Stage 1: Requirements
  await launchAgent('business-analyst', { issue: issueNumber });

  // Stage 2: Planning
  await launchAgent('issue-planner', { issue: issueNumber });

  // Stage 3: Implementation
  await launchAgent('issue-implementer', { plan: `PLAN-ISSUE-${issueNumber}.md` });

  // Stage 4: Testing (with retry loop)
  let testResult = await launchAgent('implementation-tester', { issue: issueNumber });
  while (testResult.status !== 'PASS') {
    await launchAgent('issue-implementer', {
      mode: 'fix',
      issues: testResult.issuesFound
    });
    testResult = await launchAgent('implementation-tester', { issue: issueNumber });
  }

  // Stage 5: Code Review (with retry loop)
  const pr = await createPullRequest(issueNumber);
  let reviewResult = await launchAgent('code-reviewer', { pr: pr.number });
  while (reviewResult.status === 'CHANGES_REQUESTED') {
    await launchAgent('issue-implementer', {
      mode: 'address-review',
      feedback: reviewResult.comments
    });
    reviewResult = await launchAgent('code-reviewer', { pr: pr.number });
  }

  // Stage 6: Merge
  await mergePullRequest(pr.number);

  return { status: 'complete', pr: pr.number };
}
```

### Pattern 2: Bug Fix (Expedited Pipeline)
```typescript
async function orchestrateBugFix(issueNumber: number) {
  // Bugs might skip business-analyst if requirements are clear

  // Stage 1: Planning (simplified for bugs)
  await launchAgent('issue-planner', {
    issue: issueNumber,
    mode: 'bugfix'
  });

  // Stage 2-6: Same as feature
  // But with higher priority and urgency
}
```

### Pattern 3: Hotfix (Fast-Track)
```typescript
async function orchestrateHotfix(issueNumber: number) {
  // Critical bug in production - minimize process

  // Quick plan
  await launchAgent('issue-planner', {
    issue: issueNumber,
    mode: 'hotfix'
  });

  // Implement
  await launchAgent('issue-implementer', {
    issue: issueNumber,
    priority: 'critical'
  });

  // Test (critical path only)
  await launchAgent('implementation-tester', {
    issue: issueNumber,
    mode: 'critical-only'
  });

  // Fast-track review
  await launchAgent('code-reviewer', {
    pr: prNumber,
    mode: 'security-and-critical'
  });

  // Immediate release
  await launchAgent('release-engineer', {
    mode: 'hotfix',
    version: 'patch'
  });
}
```

### Pattern 4: Release Coordination
```typescript
async function orchestrateRelease() {
  // Check if ready for release
  const readyPRs = await getReadyPRs();

  if (readyPRs.length >= 5 || hasHighPriorityFeature()) {
    await launchAgent('release-engineer', {
      prs: readyPRs,
      type: 'minor' // or 'major', 'patch'
    });
  }
}
```
