> **AI Agents**: Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) first - it has all workflows, architecture, and task patterns.

YOU MUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE USER. DO NOT DO WORK THAT IS NOT MENTIONED. IF YOU WHERE GIVEN A LONG RUNNING TASK, DO NOT PAUSE INBETWEEN. WORK AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO FINISH EVERYTHING. IF YOU ARE UNSURE ABOUT SOMETHING, ASK THE USER FOR CLARIFICATION, IN THE BEGINNING. MAKE USE OF AGENTS. MAKE USE OF COMMANDS. 
- always test you own implementation and browser console via playwright
- deploy to lcoal first and test using playwright
- deploy to githubpages only after i said so
