### Issue: Set the License File Correctly

#### Importance of Proper Licensing
Setting the correct license for your project is crucial as it defines how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. A proper license helps to protect your rights as a creator while also providing clarity to others who may want to utilize your work. It can enhance collaboration and foster community contributions.

#### Suggested License Options:
1. **MIT License**  
   - A permissive license that is simple and easy to understand. It allows for reuse within proprietary software, making it a popular choice.

2. **Apache License 2.0**  
   - Provides an express grant of rights to use, reproduce, and distribute the software under specific terms. It also includes an explicit grant of patent rights from contributors.

3. **GNU General Public License (GPL)**  
   - A copyleft license that ensures that any modified versions of the project are also open source. Ideal for projects that want to ensure future contributions remain free.

4. **BSD License**  
   - Similar to the MIT License but with additional clauses related to the use of the project's name and derived products.

Please evaluate these options based on your project’s goals and select an appropriate license to include in the repository.
