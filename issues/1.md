**Proposal for Using GitHub Wiki for Documentation**  
  
**Overview:**  
This issue proposes the exploration of GitHub Wiki as a platform for our project documentation. Utilizing a wiki can help us organize and centralize knowledge, making it easier for contributors and users to find specific information.  
  
**Benefits of Using GitHub Wiki:**  
1. **Centralized Information:** A single location for all documentation-related information can help avoid fragmentation.  
2. **Easy Editing:** Contributors can edit and update the wiki easily without needing to pull requests for minor changes.  
3. **Version Control:** Changes to the wiki are tracked, allowing us to maintain historical context for important decisions.  
  
**Potential Structure:**  
- **Home:** Overview of the project and links to key sections of the wiki.  
- **Installation Guide:** Step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project.  
- **User Guide:** Detailed usage instructions for end-users.  
- **API Documentation:** Information about using the project's API, including examples and endpoints.  
- **Contributing:** Guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards and issue reporting.  
- **FAQs:** Common questions and answers regarding the project.  
  
**Examples of Potential Content:**  
- **Installation Guide:** Installation steps for various platforms.  
- **Usage:** Examples of regular usage scenarios or common configurations.  
- **API Endpoints:** Details about available API endpoints, request/response examples, and error handling.  
  
**Next Steps:**  
1. Evaluate the current documentation and identify areas that could benefit from a wiki structure.  
2. Gather feedback from contributors on this proposal.  
3. If agreed, create a dedicated wiki and/or migrate relevant documentation into it.  
  
**Feedback:**  
Contributors are encouraged to provide their thoughts on this proposal, share any concerns, and suggest additional sections or guidelines that should be addressed. Your input is valuable in determining how we can improve our project's documentation!
